Website Application for a Grocery Delivery Service

Uses Node.js to implement a store of items, which can be added by users.  A user adds items they want to the store, then I go to the grocery store to buy the items for them for a fee.  Payments through venmo.  Operating out of Hamilton College scheduled for the summer of 2017.
